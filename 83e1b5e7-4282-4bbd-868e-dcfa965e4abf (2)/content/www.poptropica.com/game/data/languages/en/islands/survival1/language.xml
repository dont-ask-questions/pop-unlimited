			<text1>This kindling is too wet to use!</text1>
			<text2>I need to move around more or else I'll freeze!</text2>
			<text3>I can't build a fire here...</text3>

			<text5>That was a rough landing!</text5>
			<text6>Where's he going?</text6>
			<text7>I'll never be able to move this without help!</text7>

			<text10>I don't want to rip it.</text10>
			<text11>I don't think I can reach it from here.</text11>
			<text12>I already found the striker that fell.</text12>
			<text13>It's too windy to build a fire here.</text13>
			<text14>The fire's too wet to stay lit.</text14>
