	<description>The Poptropolis Games have returned! Once every 100 years, the ancient capital of Poptropica — Poptropolis — rises from the sea to host a tournament created to prove tribal supremacy. Each of the tribes of Poptropica sends a representative to compete across a series of grueling events for a chance to become the Champion of Poptropica. This time, you'll have to test your skill with two new events: the Volcano Race and Octopus Volleyball! Do you have what it takes to vanquish the competition and win glory for your tribe?</description>
