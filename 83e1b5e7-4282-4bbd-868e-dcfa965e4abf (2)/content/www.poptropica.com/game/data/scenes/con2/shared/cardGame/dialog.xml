		<statement id="start">Welcome to the Mighty Action Force Card Game!  To win you need to collect exactly 13 gems.</statement> 
		<statement id="firstTurn">At the start of the game you usually want to collect as many gems as you can.</statement>
		<statement id="enemyAlmost13">Looks like I'm getting close to the goal. You might want to attack to keep me from reaching 13.</statement>  
		<statement id="playerAlmost13">Remember, to win you need exactly 13 gems. If you go over 13 you'll lose the gems you just collected.</statement>  
		<statement id="win">You played a great game for a beginner.</statement>  
		<statement id="lose">Great game, you really caught on quick!</statement> 
		<statement id="tie">Looks like we tied.  You're quite good for a beginner. </statement>
		
		<statement id="enemy_used_block">unless you play something stronger, this card will block your move this turn.</statement>
		<statement id="enemy_used_skip">playing this card forces your opponent to miss their next turn.</statement>
		<statement id="enemy_used_both">with this card, i can play a card on both slots in the same turn.</statement>
		<statement id="enemy_used_steal">besides the normal action, this card also gives me one of your gems.</statement>
		<statement id="enemy_used_draw">when i play this card, i get to add an extra card to my hand.</statement> 
		<statement id="enemy_out_of_cards">I played all my cards, but the games goes on until both players are out of cards, or some one reaches 13.</statement> 
		<statement id="player_blocked">because that card was less than or equal to my card, you were blocked.</statement>

		<statement id="start">The only thing that makes me happier than playing the Mighty Action Force card game is winning it.</statement>
		<statement id="enemyAlmost13">This is so exciting! no offense.</statement>  
		<statement id="playerAlmost13">You're doing a great job. But it's not over yet!</statement>  
		<statement id="win">I hope I've learned something in defeat.</statement>  
		<statement id="lose">Everyone who plays this game is a winner. I'm just more of a winner than you.</statement> 
		<statement id="tie">I like when a game ends in a tie. Equality is groovy!</statement> 
		
		<statement id="enemy_blocked">trying to block me eh.</statement>
		<statement id="player_blocked">not to be rude, but I can't let you do that.</statement>

		<statement id="enemy_used_skip">hate to say it, but i'm going to be skipping your next turn.</statement>

		<statement id="player_used_steal">hey! that was mine!</statement>
		<statement id="enemy_used_steal">stealing is wrong. I prefer to think of this as sharing.</statement>
		<statement id="player_used_draw">take a card why don't yeah.</statement>
		<statement id="enemy_used_draw">I wish I could draw every card in the deck, but i'll settle for just one.</statement>

		<statement id="win">Not bad! with the right deck you could probably beat anyone.</statement>  
		<statement id="lose">Honestly, I thought you'd put up more of a fight.</statement> 
		<statement id="tie">well, that was anticlimactic.</statement> 
		
		<statement id="enemy_blocked">trying to block me eh.</statement>
