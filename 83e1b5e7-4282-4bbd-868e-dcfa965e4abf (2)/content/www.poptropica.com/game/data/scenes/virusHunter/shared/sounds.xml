<!-- 

movement_small_engine_01_L - This sound plays whenever the player moves their ship. Should fade in and out quickly. A fade in/out is not vital but it would help loads.
music_boss_theme_01_L - when that huge black virus looking ship appears at the end of wave 1. I assumed this, and others like it were bosses.
music_ingame_theme_01_L - self explanatory. Used while playing the game.
music_stats_screen_01_L - I wasn't sure if this game was actually winnable or if it was a "play until you drop!" type thing. So this clip is pleasant sounding which can be used for both defeat and victory purposes.
player_death_01 - retro sounding destruction sound. I didn't want to include an explosion sound as having the player explode didn't seem like the best way to tackle it. Gels better with the music. 

player_hit_bullets_01 - when the player is hit by bullets being fired at them rather then being bounced away by direct collisions
player_hit_collision_0x [1-3] - when player is hit by the viruses directly 

power_up_pickup_01 - pick up a power upgrade. Applies to all

switch_weapons_01 - when player clicks ship and their arsenal opens up.
weapon_dual_shot_lvl_x [1-4] - various levels of fire for the dual cannon. 
weapon_electric_zap_01 - I wasn't sure what this did. That light bulb looking thing that flashes periodically. It didn't seem to hurt the enemies at all.
weapon_laser_blade_hum_1_L - self explanatory. The hum that plays when the blade is out. This should also play after player has opened up their entire arsenal to select a weapon, and fade out when the blade is put away.
weapon_selected_01 - after a weapon has been picked and the rest are put away.
weapon_single_shot_lvl_1 - for the green mound like weapon that shoots a single pellet. I couldn't kill anything with this weapon, not sure what it does.
