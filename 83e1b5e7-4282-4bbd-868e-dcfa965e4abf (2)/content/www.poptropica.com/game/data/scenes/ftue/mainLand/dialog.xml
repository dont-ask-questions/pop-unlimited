		<statement id="memories" link="long_ago">A race, you say? That reminds me of when I was a young adventurer.</statement>
		<statement id="long_ago" link="dreams">I was a young man preparing to live my dreams.</statement>
		<statement id="dreams" link="father">Everyone wants to follow their dreams, but mine were different.</statement>
		<statement id="father" link="voyage">My father was always supportive, but even he couldn't keep up.</statement>
		<statement id="voyage" link="one_day">I went on my voyage to many distant islands, only to be foiled.</statement>
		<statement id="one_day" link="afraid">Until one day I came across a troop of monkeys.</statement>
		<statement id="afraid" link="knew">At first I was afraid. One might say I was petrified.</statement>
		<statement id="knew" link="smoothies">But deep down inside I knew that this is where I belonged.</statement>
		<statement id="smoothies" link="dreams">The fruit smoothies brought me back to an earlier time when I was younger...</statement>
		
		<statement id="long_story_short" link="digress">And that's how I ended up at this resort.</statement>
		<statement id="digress" link="help" linkEntityId="player">But I digress. You want to re-enter the race?</statement>
		<statement id="need" link="stuff" linkEntityId="amelia">But of course. Just bring me some rope, a cloth, and a refreshing fruit drink.</statement>
		<statement id="stop_bell">Quit ringing the bell, I'm right here!</statement>		
		
		<statement event="three_ingredients">Remember, bring me three things: cloth, rope, and a fruit drink.</statement>
		<statement event="has_crusoe_item" triggerEvent="triggerEvent" triggerEventArgs="give_items">Have any items for me?</statement>
		
		<statement event="gave_rope">The rope is not enough. I still need a cloth and drink.</statement>	
		<statement event="gave_canvas">The cloth is a start, but I need rope and that drink to put it all together</statement>
		<statement event="gave_drink">This sure is refreshing. Can't do anything without the rope or cloth though.</statement>
		<statement event="gave_rope_canvas">Just a drink away from entering the race! Make sure to add fruit to the machine.</statement>
		<statement event="gave_rope_drink">I still need that cloth. I thought the fruit was originally in one...</statement>
		<statement event="gave_canvas_drink">Could just use some rope to bring it all together.</statement>
		
		<statement id="gave_all" link="wait">Wait here while I work my magic.</statement>
		<statement id="wait">No one is to disturb me. I must have complete concentration.</statement>
		<statement id="hammock">Uh? What? Nothing like a cold drink.</statement>
		<statement id="rested">My best work comes when I'm rested.</statement>
