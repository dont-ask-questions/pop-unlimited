<!--so. basically, this is where we test the html going into our json files and picking out a random number from defaultAppearances, then going into hair.json to see what url they have. js is gonna get that url, and post it inside the thingy. if their number has more than one attribute (aka certain hairs), json adds a certain html line to piece together the stuff, which will be in <svg class=hair>. maybe i have to go to codepen to piece them together as a single div before getting js to add that...
anyways, this is gonna be for the sign in page.-->
